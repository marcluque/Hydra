/**
 * Created with love by DataSecs on 01.10.2017.
 *
 * A session in Hydra represents a connection between two sockets. It includes netty's channel and all other options to
 * write to the pipeline. The session is supposed to be the most important part for the user, as it provides the possibility
 * to write to the channel of the session and interact with the connected opponent (client or server,
 * depending of where the session is accessed).
 * <br>
 * For an instruction about usage visit the article
 * <a href="https://github.com/DataSecs/Hydra/wiki/Sessions">sessions</a> in the Hydra wiki.
 * <br>
 * For an example of how to work with the session, visit the
 * <a href="https://github.com/DataSecs/Hydra/tree/master/client/src/test/java/client">client example</a>
 * or the <a href="https://github.com/DataSecs/Hydra/tree/master/server/src/test/java/server">server example</a>.
