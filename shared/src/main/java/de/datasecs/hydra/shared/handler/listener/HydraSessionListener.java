/**
 * Created with love by DataSecs on 02.12.2017.
 *
 * The session listener interface is supposed to provide the user the opportunity to easily catch the probably
 * most important session events. The connecting and disconnecting of clients. The interface works for both sides,
 * client, as well as server.
 *
 * For an example of how to work with the session listener, visit the
 * <a href="https://github.com/DataSecs/Hydra/tree/master/client/src/test/java/client">client example</a>
 * or the <a href="https://github.com/DataSecs/Hydra/tree/master/server/src/test/java/server">server example</a>.
